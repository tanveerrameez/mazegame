1. We read the maze from a file Maze1.txt
Assumptions of the file:
a. Assuming each line represents a maze line
b. The maze lines are of same length

Limitation:
1. boundary conditions were not checked due to lack of time. 
Ideally the movement cannot go beyond the maze boundaries and an exception thrown
